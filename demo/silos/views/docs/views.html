<h3>Silo Views</h3>
<p>
    Silo Views are the most powerful component of the framework.
    Views allow you to bind dom elements external html sources.
    Views dispatch a load event when a url is fetched and rendered.
    The default behavior for the view.load event is to re-render the view.target dom object.
